## Getting started

Actually the only available driver is written for Couchbase, so you can use it
dirrectly : [Sofa ODM](http://ichiriac.github.io/sofa-odm/)

You can also start to write your own driver, so you have just to start a new project and add nodm as a dependency :

```sh
npm install nodm --save
```
