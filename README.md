## Getting started

Pick a driver to use depending on your NoSQL server :

- [CouchBase : Sofa ODM](https://github.com/ichiriac/sofa-odm/)
- [Redis : ReDM](https://github.com/ichiriac/sofa-odm/)


## Writing a new driver

You can also start to write your own driver, so you have just to start a new project and add nodm as a dependency :

```sh
npm install nodm --save
```

Take a look at already implemented drivers
